Adds action links to user table to approve or unapprove user registrations.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you approve or reject user registrations.
While a user is unapproved, he/she canâ€™t access the WordPress Admin.

On activation of the plugin, all existing users will automatically be flagged Approved. The blog admin will never experience restricted access and does not need approval.

= Translations =

I will be more than happy to update the plugin with new locales, as soon as I receive them!
